This python program is an attempt at using machine learning and natural language processing in order to classify movies as male
or female centric. The machine learning model that was tried to be used was DecisionTreeClassifier and several wikipedia modules 
and APIs were imported and utilised in order to extract and read the wikipedia pages of movies and films and check for male centric
keywords in their plot summaries.
